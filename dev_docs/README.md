# Developer Documentation

This directory contains in-depth notes for developers (human or AI) working on
the Glasgow Constraint Solver. Each document covers one architectural area in
more detail than the top-level `README.md` does.

These docs are aimed at people changing the solver's code, not at users of the
library. For an introduction to *using* the solver, start with the top-level
`README.md`.

## Contents

- [Implementing a constraint](constraints.md) — the structural pattern every
  constraint follows: class shape, the `install` method, the propagator
  framework, triggers, the inference and justification APIs, OPB encoding
  building blocks, and the testing pattern. Start here when adding any new
  constraint.
- [Reification](reification.md) — additional machinery for *reified* constraints:
  the `ReificationCondition` static and `EvaluatedReificationCondition` runtime
  types, the `install_reified_dispatcher` helper, the OPB encoding pattern,
  and the conventions for writing new reified constraints. Read
  `constraints.md` first.
- [MiniZinc bindings](minizinc.md) — how the `minizinc/` directory plugs into
  the MiniZinc / FlatZinc ecosystem: `fzn-glasgow`, the `mznlib/` predicate
  overrides, `.msc` solver-config files, the cross-solver test harness, and
  the recipe for exposing an existing C++ constraint.

More documents will be added here as we build up coverage of other parts of
the codebase.
