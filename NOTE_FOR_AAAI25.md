# Supplementary Material for "Certifying Bounds Propagation for Integer Multiplication Constraints"

The implementation of the propagator and proof logging procedure discussed in the paper is in 
`gcs/constraints/mult_bc.cc`

The implementation of the experiments and fractions examples is in
`mult_experiments`

For installation/running follow the first two instructions in `README.md` and then 
run 
`build/n_fractions`
or
`build/single_mult`
as desired. Not that this requires VeriPB to be installed.
