========================

- Set up clang-format in a reasonable way.

- Switch to a modern build system.

- Run proof log tests automatically.

- Set up some kind of continuous integration.

- What happens if a constraint is created entirely on constant variables?

- What happens if a variable appears multiple times in the same constraint?
